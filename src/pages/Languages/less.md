## Variables
Quickly access your variables from the current document or any imported files. The tooltip shows the value of each variable so you don't have to guess.

## Mixins
The editor provides both [IntelliSense](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hcw1s69b.aspx) and tooltips for Mixins in the same file as well as across imported files.

## Go to definition
Easily jump between Mixins and variable references using `F12` to go to the definition. This works for any references even across multiple files and imports.
